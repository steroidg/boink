Pros:
- Tasks are performed in an orderly fashion that's easy to understand.
- Can become a non priviledged user.
- Vault is built into the command.
- Doesn't need infrastructure so it's easy to integrate.
- Everything can be in yaml, which is easy to read.

Cons:
- Postgresql module requrie non priviledged user to perform tasks.
- Non-priviledged users fiddly (needs to enable pipe)
- Package management module inconsistent (apt accepts lists where as npm doesn't)
- While there is data/code separation, so far I haven't seen anything that matches the capability of hiera.
- Push model which requries client side dependency fiddling.
- I find the presence of spaces in data disturbing.
- Failed to start service resource appears as changed instead of failed.
- Lack of r10k equivalent capability.
